# ChronoVault
*Autonomous Dollar-Cost Averaging on Massa Blockchain*

## Overview

ChronoVault is the first autonomous DCA platform leveraging Massa's unique self-scheduling smart contracts. Unlike traditional DCA solutions that rely on external keeper bots, ChronoVault contracts execute themselves on-chain, providing true decentralization and eliminating single points of failure.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/juliusjulyp/chronovault.git
cd chronovault

# Install and deploy
npm install
npm run deploy
```
